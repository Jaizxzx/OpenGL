# OpenGL
This is a basic graphic pipeline which contains two tests :
1. Color Test - It can generate the color specified for the current size of the screen with the given R G B values.
2. Texture Generation Test - It can generate any specified texture( a tiger image texture twice for this case )

For the GUI it uses the library imgui v1.60
and for Reading the texture I have used stb_image
for the transformation and other mathematics related stuff I have used glm
